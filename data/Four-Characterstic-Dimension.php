So too with our apostolate, we cooperate and coordinate. To facilitate harmoniously and effectively the tasks of each member, the SVD-PHS has chosen four coordinators for Communication, Mission Animation, Justice and Peace and Bible Apostolate. The team is expected to work in collaboration with the provincial superior in implementing the realignment program of the province.');
