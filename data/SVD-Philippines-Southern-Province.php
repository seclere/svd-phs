We also have specialized apostolates in the slum areas, with sexually abused children, as well as with indigenous people; we do hospital chaplaincy, manage radio stations, enterprises and retreat centers, undertake Justice and Peace and Integrity of Creation projects and engage in the Bible ministry.');
