These marginalized families and individuals are adopted by the congregation as partners and collaborators of the mission. Adopted communities include slum areas, communities of fishermen and sexually abused children. Only gifted confreres can offer their time and effort to this kind of apostolate and the PHS is blessed with some members.');
