  $document->paragraphAdd('The SVD - Societas Verbi Divini (Latin), Society of the Divine Word (English), or plainly Divine Word Missionaries - is a modern international religious missionary congregation for men founded by Saint Arnold Janssen in 1875 in Steyl, Holland. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Saint Arnold Janssen answered the need of the Church in his time by founding two other religious congregations for women: the missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit (SSpS) and the Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit for Perpetual Adoration (SSpSAP).');
